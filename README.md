PatternAgents Workshops
=======================

PatternAgents develops a variety of open source and commercial training seminars and workshops. 
We provide embedded hardware, firmware, and IDE tools training for private and public companies,  industry groups, educational and other groups.

PatternAgents focuses on "Hand's On" training workshops that enable the attendees to leave with a working knowledge of key fundamentals in each subject area.
The Workshops build up commonly needed frameworks (Real-Time Operating Systems and Drivers, for one example) that the attendees can use as starting points to build real applications.
